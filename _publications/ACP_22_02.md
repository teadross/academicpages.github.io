Abstract: Dragonfly is an important network topology for data centers to efficiently serve high-performance computing (HPC) traffic flows. In this paper, we construct a WSS-based all-optical data center network (DCN) with Dragonfly topology and investigate its routing, wavelength, and time slot allocation (RWTA) problem. Two heuristic algorithms, including the shortest-path-based (SP) algorithm and the least-delay-path-based (LDP) algorithm, are proposed. Simulation results show that the LDP algorithm is efficient in improving the performance of the proposed all-optical DCN with Dragonfly topology in terms of task completion time (TCT).
