excerpt: 'To deliver Ring allreduce services in a wavelength selective switch (WSS)-based all-optical rearrangeable Clos network, we propose a two-dimensional matrix-based resource assignment algorithm. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in time-slot and wavelength resource assignment.'
