In this paper, we study the deployment problem of distributed dedicated protection services in mobile edge computing. To minimize the total delay, we develop an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and efficient polling based heuristic algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed double polling based algorithm can effectively reduce the total delay of all services and balance loads of the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers.
