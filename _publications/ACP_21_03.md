Abstract: To protect mobile edge computing (MEC) services in a fiber-wireless (FiWi) access network, we propose a load-balanced protection (LBP) strategy. Simulations show that LBP strategy is efficient in terms of maximum load on servers and bandwidth resource consumption compared to two benchmark protection schemes.
