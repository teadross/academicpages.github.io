collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ACP_21_01
excerpt: 'We propose a wavelength selective switch (WSS) based all-optical data center network (DCN) in Torus topology. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to deliver distributed machine learning (DML) services. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches achieve short service execution time and low lightpath signal loss.'
