Hello, I am Jiemin Lin, a master's student at Soochow University. My research background is in electrical engineering and network communication, and I focus on optimizing network performance (mainly optical networks). I have a cheerful disposition. If you are interested in me personally, or if you have any questions about my research, please contact me via email. Normally, I will reply to you within a day.

Research Interests
======  
My research interests mainly include two parts. One is the optimization problems in mobile or multi-access edge computing and all-optical data centers. Another is the blocking theory, including the set theory for non-blocking networks and the queueing theory for blocking networks.

Mobile or Multi-access Edge Computing
------ 
In terms of Mobile or Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), I focus on network survivability problems. Specifically, I proposed Integer Linear Programming models for service protection in MEC, and designed heuristic algorithms for AP and link protection in MEC.

Data Center Networks
------ 
For data center networks, I focused on the topics of all-optical data centers. I focus on different services in data center networks, including unicast, multicast and co-flow services. I designed some all-optical network architectures for each of these services for efficient service deployment.

Optical Switching
------
In optical switching, I am interested in two different topics, including the blocking theory of optical switching architectures and the design of next-generation Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) architectures. On the one hand, I have derived the strictly non-blocking conditions and the blocking probability analytical models for several different optical switching architectures. On the other hand, I have designed some novel ROADM architectures. These are my most rewarding research.
