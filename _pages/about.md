Hello, I am Jamin Lin, a master student at Soochow University. My research background is in electrical engineering and network communication, and I focus on optimizing network performence (mainly optical networks). I had a cheerful disposition. If you are interested in me personally, or if you have any questions about my research, please contact me via email. Normally, I will reply to you within a day.

Research Interests
====== 
Mobile or Multi-access Edge Computing
------ 
In terms of Mobile/Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), I focus on the network survivability problems. Specifically, I proposed an Integer Linear Programming models for service protection in MEC, and designed a heuristic algorithm for AP and link protection in MEC.

Data Center Networks
------ 
For data center networks, I focused on the toptics of all-optical data centers. I focus on two kinds of services in data center networks, namely unicast service and co-flow service. I designed some all-optical network architectures for each of these two services for efficiently service deployment.

Optical Switching
------
In optical switching, I am interested in two different toptics, including the blocking performance of optical switching architectures and the design of next generation Reconfigurable Optical Add.Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) architectures. I have derived the strictly non-blocking conditions for several different optical switching architectures and designed some novel ROADM architectures. These are my most rewarding researches.

My background
======
Most Important Thing
------ 
I am Jia-Xin-Tang
My GOD is JIARAN.

Some Tiny Awards
------
I won the National Scholarship in 2022
I won the Pacemaker to Merit Student in 2019
